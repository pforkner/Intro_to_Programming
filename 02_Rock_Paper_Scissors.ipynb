A winner is determined by the following rules: rock beats scissors (because it can smash the scissors), but loses to paper (since paper covers the rock). Scissors beats paper (because it cuts paper).\n","\n","Using the `input` function, ask the user to enter a 1, 2, or 3 (for rock, paper, or scissors, respectively). Then, use `random.randint()` to generate a random computer choice of 1, 2, or 3. Determine who wins (including ties) using conditional statements and then print the outcome."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"9be9bc62-454a-4d23-b6b8-117e4cfcf187","metadata":{"id":"9be9bc62-454a-4d23-b6b8-117e4cfcf187"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Solution goes here"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"69f4067c-4202-4c25-b989-b1648659e97d","metadata":{"id":"69f4067c-4202-4c25-b989-b1648659e97d"},"source":["# Questions"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b430a545-223c-4250-8f42-501e8286ed0a","metadata":{"id":"b430a545-223c-4250-8f42-501e8286ed0a"},"source":["1.
