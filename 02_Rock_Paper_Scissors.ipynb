    "Rock, paper, scissors is a game played between two people where each person simultaneously picks either rock, paper, or scissors. A winner is determined by rock beats scissors (because it can smash the scissors), but it loses to paper (since paper covers the rock). Scissors beats paper (because it cuts paper).\n",
